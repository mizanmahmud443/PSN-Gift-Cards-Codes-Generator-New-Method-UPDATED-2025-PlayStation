Free PSN codes are digital keys that give you access to the PlayStation Network without needing a subscription. These codes can be redeemed on the PlayStation Store to purchase games, movies, and other digital content. They’re often distributed by Sony or trusted third-party websites during promotions, giveaways, or as rewards for completing tasks.  

To redeem a code, simply log in to your PlayStation account, enter the code, and click “Continue” for verification. Once confirmed, the credit will be applied to your account immediately.
